Please give the necessary ingredients first, then the instructions for creating the recipe. At the moment I have the following ingredients: Vegetable broth, Parsley, Noodles, Ham, Onion, and the following seasonings: Thyme, Thyme, Rosemary, Parsley, and Black Pepper.\n\nStep One – Select a Soup and Soup Part\n\nFirst, get a good broth. You can find great broth at a food stand in New York. Use a good quality vegetable broth (usually from your local grocery store. I use a vegetable broth from my local supermarket.)\n\nStep Two – Select a Soup Part\n\nI usually prefer to use a chicken, beef, or seafood soup and I use a blend of pork, beef, and seafood in the above picture.\n\nStep Three – Chop the Vegetables (using your favorite vegetable peeler)\n\nNext, select your vegetables. If you are making a \"mixed\" soup, you will chop the vegetables together and put them on one small serving plate. This way you do not have to have all of the vegetables at once. In my example, I will be cooking a chicken soup with chicken, ham, and pork. I will also have the mushrooms, green beans, and onions in the mix.\n\nStep Four – Mix the Seasonings Together\n\nNext, add the seasoning mix to the soup. I tend to use more seasoning mix than necessary to get the desired flavor. In my case I will have black pepper, thyme, parsley, and rosemary. I don't like parsley so I can't add any. I also want the flavor to be mild so I do not add salt (I prefer kosher.) In the picture below I have used an olive oil based spice blend.\n\nStep Five – Make the Soup!\n\nPlace the soup on a plate or soup pot that is large enough to accommodate your soup, add the onion and cut side of the mushroom. You will need to cut a very small piece of your mushroom if you want to use it as the meat of the meatball.\n\nOnce you place the mushrooms on the mushroom, place the meatballs on top of the mushroom. (Don't over-bake.) Add your meatballs to the meatballs that have mushroom on them. You can also make this a double meatball and then place half the meatballs on the other half and cut the other half into strips to make meatballs. Use whatever length you want the meatballs to be.\n\nStep Six – Add the Cheese and Breadcrumbs\n\nAdd your breadcrumbs to the breadcrumbs you made earlier and spoon the meatballs (and the mushroom) over the breadcrumbs. Do not over-mix the breadcrumbs, this helps prevent sticking.\n\nStep Seven – Bake the Meatballs\n\nBring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the meatballs according to your recipe. I will often cook them 4-5 minutes per side. Once the meatballs are done, place them on a serving dish and finish it off with a dollop of yogurt. Serve your meatballs with yogurt and some parmesan cheese.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this recipe.

This meal is for 4 people: one person to make the curry, one person to serve it and 2 people to help me clean and prepare my cooking.\n\nI would like you to make the meal together with me if you want to. In addition, I'll be taking some cooking notes on my cell phone so that I can share them with you later. I would love to hear how it goes, and if it all goes well, maybe you would be able to visit me later! (I've never been to India before, and I know many things there can be quite complicated. I've also only eaten vegetarian food before – I've never seen veg-eaters there, so I guess I'm at a disadvantage, but I'm hoping this helps!)\n\nI have been a vegetarian for many years, and it's an extremely nice feeling to be doing something that I love in the way that I am doing it.\n\nPlease don't think this is a scam! I'm making money through this, I'm doing it because I love cooking and I am happy with what I've done so far. That said, I do have some expenses and if I am to have a happy living, I need money. (I live alone. I make my own bread, coffee, tea, food, clothes and toiletries, and I do use some expensive materials like the curry paste that goes with the beef. Some of my ingredients may have to be bought again with this money in order for me to cook the meal myself. In other words, this is not an easy meal!) I don't mind paying someone to cook or help me with my cooking, I only ask that you don't take advantage of me!\n\nI hope this is possible to make and that you can share it with others. :) I'd be most grateful if you could help support me on my journey so that I can go on to create dishes and meals for people all over the world (and maybe make some extra money as well, I have some savings!).\n\nThank you for your support! :)\n\nIf you find my quest to cook a perfect vegetarian meal easy to understand, please comment and tell me how it goes. (I'm looking forward to meeting you too!)\n\nHave fun! :)"

Please give the necessary ingredients first, then the instructions for creating the recipe. At the moment I have the following ingredients: Oat flakes, Curry, Rice, Strawberries, Milk, Eggs and Butter. What does that amount mean? It's about 5 servings for each serving. So you would be doing a little more than a serving of oats and about a cup of rice and about half a cup of curry. And the coconut oil can be about 4 tbsp, if you want a different texture. The cooking method is the same for all kinds of food. It might be different for other kind of food. The following picture is what a dish like this looks like. It uses a bit more coconut oil than it looks on the picture. That's because my daughter uses a little more coconut oil than most mothers. So it's more like a 1-2 tbsp more than the picture, if you would like. I find that is the best recipe for cooking coconut rice in the kitchen. If you want to add more or less coconut oil, the rice and beans can be mixed more or less. You can also just use just rice and beans for a rice and bean curry recipe, instead of beans. In that case you would use 2/3 of the rice and 1/3 of the beans. Or if you would like to mix coconut and soy milk, you could instead use just 2 tbsp of coconut milk. I have made this in an 8 quart, all stainless steel, non-stick saucepan. The other important thing is that you should always use coconut oil that is hot or at least warm. Otherwise the oil will dry out during cooking, and then the coconut oil would not have enough nutrition to maintain the flavor of the curry, but I will show you another recipe to use the leftover oil. You should also be careful with the way you mix the ingredients. If it's really sticky, you can put it in a small dish in a pan, or place it into a saucepan and mix it with cold water. But you can also put it into a big bowl with a fork, and blend it for 5-10 minutes until it's really smooth. Also if you're using rice or beans, just throw them in for the coconut milk. The amount of coconut milk depends on the rice or beans. If you use rice for the coconut milk, the extra milk can be used to make another curry recipe. It will also be less rice than if you use just the coconut milk. So if you have a little more rice, then you can add more coconut milk than usual to make it even more creamy, and then you can use it to make another curry recipe. The amount of coconut milk depends on the size of the bowl and whether you use rice or beans. So if it's really small, then you may have to use the extra milk, even if you have just rice and beans. It may be even better if you use the extra milk to make coconut milk pancakes. So I have made this recipe several times and it has worked. If you have a large bowl of rice or beans, you probably don't need the extra coconut milk. Then, if you have just rice and beans for the coconut milk, you can leave out the extra coconut milk. The recipe will be about the same each time. I find that it's really easy to use the leftover oil when using it in another recipe."

At the moment I have the following ingredients: Kidney beans, Shrimp, Garlic, Onion, Salt, Sugar and Vegetable oil. I don't need the other ingredients so I put them on the shopping list as I know they'll be needed later on.\n\nI made one pot of chicken rice over a stovetop and put it in a 350F oven for about 35 minutes.\n\nMy mom was able to get her brother to make chicken, because he only has kids and doesn't have to be in the kitchen every time he wants chicken. That's an advantage. I was able to do the rice, because my brother's cooking skills are limited. He did a great job and he knows how to cook rice. If you want the recipe just add your information. It's very important that you give the information to your mother first, otherwise your mom will just send it to the other person for cooking.\n\nThe second cook time was about 5 hours. I was a little nervous, because my first meal was done, so I didn't eat much. When we got to my room to eat I made an amazing soup. When I looked into the oven, I saw that the rice was cooked and I could feel it. So I was very happy when I was able to eat it. The next time I had it was for dinner and it was delicious. I had a plate of chicken rice.\n\nI thought the other person might be worried about food poisoning. In fact, the guy who prepared for me did not show any signs of illness. It didn't scare him. When he finished the soup he left the kitchen, which was unusual.\n\nOne thing I liked about this recipe was that I made a lot of rice. I cooked about 3 lbs. of chicken rice. I was able to use only one pot and my mom had the tools she needed to do the dishes.\n\nThis dish was very versatile. You can make it in a pot over a gas stove or the oven or you can cook it over a stovetop. You can also cook it over the stovetop and use a saucepan instead of the pan. It was very healthy and you could cut it up for lunch later, or even make a lunchbox of it to keep in the refrigerator. I think I could have made it in the oven but I didn't feel like spending a lot of money. Maybe I didn't cook enough.\n\nIngredients:\n\n6 large chickens\n\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil (Canola, Olive, Extra Virgin, Corn, Vinegar)\n\n1 1/2 pounds chicken breast\n\n2 onions, diced\n\n4 large garlic cloves, minced\n\n4 cups vegetable stock\n\n2 pounds chicken rice (Cooks for 2-1/2 hours)\n\nDirections:\n\nPlace the chicken breast in a large saucepan. Add the oil, onions, garlic, and stock. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.\n\nCook the chicken for about 5 minutes, or until it's tender and browned. It shouldn't be done by now.\n\nWhen you start cooking the chicken remove the bones, cut the chicken into chunks and add them to the pot.\n\nCover the pot, bring it back to a boil, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.\n\nTransfer the chicken to a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the rice.\n\nSprinkle the chicken rice with lemon and salt, add the chicken to the rice, and stir to combine.\n\nServe the chicken rice topped with lemon juice, parsley, and green onion."

Remove the rice pudding from the pot and drain thoroughly. Remove any pieces that are sticking to the bottom of the pot, so that you can rinse the whole thing under cold running water. Set it aside to cool. You can save some of the rice pudding in the fridge, though it is definitely preferable to make this immediately.\n\n4. Preheat your oven to 350°F.\n\n5. Put a small frying pan on the stove and bring the oil to a medium low boil. Add your celery root and sauté for a few minutes until it has softened. Add your water and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for an hour or so until the vegetables are very soft. The meat in the middle should be pretty tender by now, though it is still firm enough to slice. Remove the meat from the pot.\n\n6. In a large bowl, combine the Balsamic vinegar, celery root, milk, olive oil, and salt. Stir until everything is mixed together and there are no large chunks of celery and fat clinging to the bottom of the bowl.\n\n7. Spread out your vegetables on a small plate and gently toss with the Balsamic. Pour on top of the vegetables and toss with the Balsamic. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour, or as long as the broccoli is cooking and won't burst.\n\n8. Now comes the tricky part. Using a 2 1/2\" spatula and scraping the excess Balsamic off of the veggies, slide the pan of water into the oven for an additional 30 minutes. This will remove most of the fat and the vegetables will fall apart very easily. After 30 minutes, remove the pan from the oven and place it in the fridge. This will take about an hour or so.\n\n9. When you are ready to slice the vegetables, remove the plastic wrap and allow to cool. The broccoli should be fork tender, but will still need to be cut with a knife.\n\n10. With a sharp paring knife, carefully cut each piece of celery into 1/4\" cubes. After each cut you may need to push the remaining celery and vegetables around in the pan for a minute or so to re-accentuate the vegetables.\n\n11. Spread on a plate and toss with your shredded Balsamic. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAdvertisements"

At the moment I have the following ingredients: Garlic powder, Pasta, Frankfurters, Parsley, Onion, Cumin, Turmeric, Cumin seeds, Black pepper, Blackberry leaf, Peppers, Lime juice, Basil.\n\nHere's a brief summary of how I will make my chicken parmesan.\n\nGarlic powder and salt. Preferably kosher (use the Kosher label and if possible use only the highest quality kosher salt as the best way to cook it).\n\n\nFirst, I will remove the skin of the chicken and wash off any dirt. There will be quite a few black and white spots in the skin. Don't worry, these will wash away. It will look like this:\n\n\nYou will notice that the chicken flesh is mostly black (more than 99% of it is black). This is the reason why the chicken is called \"parmesan chicken\" by people who don't like the black colour of the skin – it's very light.\n\nNext, I will slice the chicken into little cubes and place them on a piece of parchment paper. As long as you don't cover the pieces completely with a paper towel, it will be fine.\n\nLet's start.\n\n\nI will use my garlic powder and salt. Put the garlic powder and salt in the microwave and microwave it for 2 minutes on high (you need to do this if the garlic powder is very hot).\n\n\nPut the chicken in the microwave for another minute on high until the chicken is completely cooked. If you want, you can add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and/or onion powder to the dish. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\n\nHere is how the chicken looks once the chicken is cooked.\n\nThis is what the chicken looks like when it's done:\n\n\nThis is how it looks without the parmesan:\n\n\nThe chicken will have a very crunchy, almost crumbly, texture. It will be tough, yet moist inside. This texture is what I like most, and you can also just eat the chicken as it is. It will taste good.\n\nMy son likes to eat the chicken raw, but I will try it on the side. I've not tried it yet with any kinds of sauces, so I can't confirm that it tastes better with any of them.\n\n\nHere is how the dish looks after a day or two in the fridge:\n\n\nYou can use a whole chicken, or just cut pieces and freeze the chicken as a whole thing. For the recipe I used chicken breasts in the same package that are listed in the ingredients, just cut the chicken into little cubes for extra yummy chicken.\n\nIn case you want to try other recipes, check my other dishes:\n\nChicken Borscht\n\nChicken Breasts in Creamy Tomato Sauce\n\nChicken Breasts in Sweet Chili Sauce\n\nPasta Pasta Sauce"

I have the following measurements:\n\nMethod 1:\n\nCut the ham into bite-size pieces and then fry in oil until it is crispy\n\n2. Add the pork to the pan with the butter, cinnamon, lemon juice and salt\n\n3. Add the roasted ham to the pan, add 2 teaspoons of sugar to the pan\n\n4. Add the luscious, tender pork to the pan and cook for about 5 minutes.\n\n5. Add more butter when the bacon gets crispy, don't add enough, the bacon should be crispy like when you are eating a piece of bacon.\n\n6. Add the ham to the pan and keep it on the heat. I cooked mine for 5 minutes.\n\n7. Add the chopped mushrooms\n\n8. Add the tomato and the garlic (add garlic in a small amount if it is too dry).\n\n9. Cook for another 4 minutes or until the pork is cooked to your liking\n\n10. Add the onions and pepper and stir everything around a little\n\n11. Simmer for about 2 minutes before serving\n\nMethod 2:\n\nCombine all of the ingredients in a large bowl and let them cook over high heat until it starts to thicken\n\n12. The taste will depend on the taste you want, the first time you cook bacon this is the best way to use it. I wanted to be as spicy as possible so I reduced the sugar by 1/4 teaspoon.\n\n13. After the sauce has cooled to room temperature, I drained the sauce and transferred it to a container and sealed it, then stored it in the fridge and ate it that way, until it is just about to go bad. This was a big mistake and I now know better. It can last forever."
